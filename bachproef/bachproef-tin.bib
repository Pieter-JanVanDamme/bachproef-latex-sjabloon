    abstract="The design of hardware systems is a challenging and error-prone task, where a signifcant portion of the effort is spent for testing and verification. Usually testing and verification are applied as a post-process to the implementation. Meanwhile, for the development of software, test-first approaches such as test driven development (TDD) have become increasingly important. In this paper, we propose a new design flow based on behaviour driven development (BDD), an extension of TDD, where acceptance tests written in natural language drive the implementation. We extend this idea by allowing the specification of properties in natural language and use them as a starting point in the design flow. The flow also includes an automatic generalisation of test cases to properties that are used for formal verification. In this way, testing and formal verification are combined in a seamless manner, while keeping the requirements --- from which both tests and formal properties are derived --- in a single consistent document. The approach has been implemented and evaluated on several examples to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed flow.",
